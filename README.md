## ALMA-continuum

A2744 has been mapped by [ALMA Frontier Fields Survey](https://www.astro.puc.cl/~jgonzal/ALMA_FF.html) project, [ALMA lensing cluster survey](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019asrc.confE..64K/abstract) project, and some other projects. There are several SMGs in the north west and one SMG in the south.
